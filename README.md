# 🏦 Object-Oriented Banking System (C++)

A simple console-based banking system written in **object-oriented C++**.  
Features include deposit & withdrawal systems, loan calculator, balance display, card preview, and a helper page for user support.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Secure sign-in with age & identity validation  
- 💰 Deposit system with limit & negative value handling  
- 💸 Withdrawal with balance check  
- 📈 Live balance view with real-time updates  
- 🧠 Helper system for troubleshooting common ATM problems  
- 🏠🏎️💳 Loan page with custom offers based on income & experience

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Concepts Used

- ✅ Object-oriented programming with a `user` class  
- ✅ Encapsulation with class constructors  
- ✅ Input validation using `cin.fail()` and conditionals  
- ✅ Modular structure via header/source file separation  
- ✅ Menu and navigation logic using `switch`, `while`, and `do-while`  
- ✅ Output alignment using `iomanip` → `setw`

## 🗒️ Notes

- 📌 This is my **4th C++ project**, created to reinforce class and pointer fundamentals.  
- 🚫 No arrays or vectors were used — only classes, variables, and pure control logic.  
- 📌 I intentionally used only basic features (no file I/O, no string parsing) to focus on memory and function logic.  
- 📌 The most original parts of the project are the **Helper Page** and the **Loan Calculator**, which simulate real ATM experiences.
